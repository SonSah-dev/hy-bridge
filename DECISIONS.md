# Decision log

Each entry records what was decided, why, the evidence behind it, and its status.
**Status values:** `proposed` (a candidate, not yet tested) · `verified` (checked by inspection or measurement in this project) · `rejected` · `open` (needs a decision).
Published model claims are labelled *reported* until they have been reproduced here.

## D-001 Target hardware: CPU first, Intel acceleration optional
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** verified (hardware confirmed by the developer)
- **Context:** Windows laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H, 24 GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics. There is no CUDA and no dedicated GPU memory.
- **Decision:** every component must meet the 5 s latency requirement on the **CPU**. OpenVINO on the integrated GPU or NPU is only a time-boxed experiment.
- **Consequence:** Whisper-large-class models are not expected to keep up with real time on this CPU. Published CPU benchmarks report a real-time factor above 1 (*reported*, measured on other hardware).

## D-002 ASR candidates (not validated)
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** proposed
- **Primary:** NVIDIA `stt_hy_fastconformer_hybrid_large_pc`, run through its ONNX export (`OpenVoiceOS/stt_hy_fastconformer_hybrid_large_pc_onnx`) with `onnx-asr` on CPU. The authors' paper reports 9.9% WER for Armenian (*reported*, on read speech).
- **Time-boxed experiment (≤ 1.5 h):** `BuzzASR/armenian` (a Whisper-large-v3 fine-tune) via OpenVINO on the integrated GPU. Its model card reports 3.72% CER / 11.89% WER on FLEURS (*reported*, self-published, very new). Converting it to OpenVINO and its speed on this laptop are **untested**.
- **Rejected for now:**
  - Whisper large/turbo zero-shot: slow on CPU, weaker on Armenian.
  - SeamlessM4T v2: 2.3B parameters, non-commercial licence.
  - Omnilingual ASR: Windows support unverified.
- **To verify:** CER and real-time factor on our own conversational clips (step 3).

## D-003 Translation candidate (not validated)
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** proposed
- **Initial candidate:** NLLB-200 distilled 600M (`hye_Armn` → `eng_Latn`) via CTranslate2 int8 on CPU. Memory use of about 3 GB is *reported* by a converter's notes.
- **Fallback:** NLLB 1.3B (about 5.5 GB, *reported*), only if quality is insufficient and latency allows.
- **To verify:** whether a Helsinki `opus-mt` hy→en model exists (only en→hy has been confirmed); speed and quality on our clips (step 4).

## D-004 Speaker identification approach (not validated)
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** proposed
- **Decision:** microphone segments are always labelled `Me`. System-audio segments are labelled by **online clustering** of WeSpeaker ResNet34 embeddings (ONNX, 26.5 MB) against running cluster centroids.
- **Why not pyannote pipelines:** they are gated (accepting terms or a token is required), and their documentation describes no streaming inference.
- **To verify:** label stability on codec-compressed call audio and short segments (step 7).

## D-005 Licensing — open questions
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** open
- **The brief:** says nothing about licences. It requires local models, Python, and no model weights in the repo.
- **Known licences:**
  - NLLB-200: CC-BY-NC-4.0 (**non-commercial**)
  - SeamlessM4T: CC-BY-NC-4.0
  - FastConformer Armenian: CC-BY-4.0 (attribution required)
  - BuzzASR: MIT
  - PyAudioWPatch: MIT
- **Conflicting information:** WeSpeaker ResNet34 is tagged Apache-2.0 on Hugging Face, but WeSpeaker's documentation says VoxCeleb-trained models follow CC BY 4.0. It is treated conservatively as CC BY 4.0.
- **Still to verify:** the licence of the OpenVoiceOS ONNX export repo, the `onnx-asr` package licence, and Silero VAD's licence at its source.
- **Pending decision (developer):** accept NLLB's non-commercial licence with disclosure in the README, or require permissively licensed models only.
- Not legal advice.

## D-006 Chat-history preservation — Step 0 findings
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** verified (export from 2026-10-25 10:21 UTC inspected read-only)
- **Export format:** a manifest plus 4 ZIPs: `light_metadata`, `projects`, `memories`, `conversations`. `conversations-000.zip` contains a single `conversations.json` (a list of conversations). Download links expire after 24 h and may only work once.
- **Preserved:**
  - all user and assistant message text in full
  - timestamps, and the link from each message to the one it replies to
  - **every tool call** (name, exact input, ID, timestamp): 20 of 20
  - **tool results** with full content, including error results
  - citations (character positions + URL)
  - hidden context blocks (date notes, tool listings, memory snapshot)
  - Project docs, as text, in `projects-000.zip`
- **Gaps:**
  1. Reasoning ("thinking") is exported only as one-line summaries; the full text is hidden.
  2. Conversations have **no structured Project field**, so sessions must be tracked by conversation ID.
  3. Each message's built-in `text` field replaces tool steps with placeholders, so a converter must render the detailed `content` blocks instead.
- **Still uncertain:**
  - how workspace tools (Bash/Read/Write/Glob) and file uploads appear
  - whether every session stays a single conversation entry
  - These will be checked with a second trial export.
- **Open decisions:**
  - whether to include hidden context blocks verbatim in `chats/` (recommended: yes, clearly labelled; reviewed for privacy, but not edited)
  - when to build the converter and its completeness check (deferred by the developer)

## D-007 Repository location and remote
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** decided
- **Local:** `C:\Users\<user>\armenian-live-translate` (outside folders synced by OneDrive).
- **Remote:** a private GitHub repository, created now; the developer pushes after each verified step.
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` enforces LF in the repo so edits from Windows and from the Linux tooling stay consistent.

## D-008 Language variety
- **Date:** 2026-10-25 · **Status:** proposed (assumption)
- **Assumption:** Eastern Armenian is the target variety, because the brief does not specify one. To be revisited if the interview conditions indicate Western Armenian or code-switching.
